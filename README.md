# Boltz BTCPay Plugin

This plugin allows any merchant (even on a shared BTCPay instance) to accept Lightning payments.

It features two modi:
- Rebalance Mode: automatically manage liquidity of a connected Lightning node
- Nodeless Mode: accept Lightning payments without running a node, using Liquid swaps
